## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Unsupervised Natural Language Processing Project
One of the project's objectives is to detect emotion from written text.

The dataset for this project is the [Emotion Detection from Text](https://www.kaggle.com/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text) on Kaggle, 
it contains 40,000 tweets with their tweet_id and the associated sentiment.

The data originally has 13 sentiments which are: _empty, sadness, enthusiasm, neutral, worry, surprise, love, fun, hate, happiness, boredom, relief and anger_.

We started off by doing some exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

The table below describes the number of tweets in the dataset for each emotion:

| Sentiment | Number of Tweets |
|:---|:---:|
| neutral         |8638|
| worry      |8459|
| happiness         |5209|
| sadness         |5165|
| love      |3842|
| surprise      |2187|
| fun       |1776|
| relief      |1526|
| hate    |1323|
| empty      | 827|
| enthusiasm       | 759|
